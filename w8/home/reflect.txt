1)The difference is that a concrete class can be instantiated because
  it provides  the implementation for all of its methods.butAn abstract class cannot 
  be instantiated because at least one method has not been implemented.

2) Abstract base class contains or inherits at least one pure virtual member function.  
   The class definition contains the declaration of the pure virtual function 
   Because the class provides no implementation for its pure virtual function,
   the compiler cannot instantiate the class.  
   Any attempt to create an instance of an abstract base class generates a compiler 
   error. 


3) i have learned about defining pure virtual function and using abstact and base class
