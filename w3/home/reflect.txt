1)The size of each c- style character string that stores the account name is 40 and 41 for the objects that store the names
  this is because of the space for the null character so there is no garbage valued displayed,and exceeding the limit of the array.

2)from my code the examples of object oriented programming are using a class and accessing its objects and putting codes into 
  different modules.

3)this is allowed in c++ as the compiler identifies the identical named functions by the number of parameters passed in the function,
  whereas in c compiler doesn't know this.

4)we ensure that the balance displays upto 2 decimal places by using the cout.precision(2) and setf::iosfixed() to format the output.

5) we need to check if the sin is valid and the years entered are less than max number of years

6) i have learned to access the data from the class and orivatisation of members and using in built libraries to format the output

           const oop244& OOP244::foo() const {
	// . . . member function logic
	 return *this;
}
