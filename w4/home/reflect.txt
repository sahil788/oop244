Ans1: By putting the members in safe empty state we assure that the members don't have any garbage value inside them.

Ans2: We could've used just one constructor with 5 parameters and make three different cases so that we may 
      skip most of the code.

Ans3: By minimizing code duplication the compiler performs statements that requires compilation 
      just once and not everytime when checking conditions.it also executes faster.

Ans4: Because we're passing a class through parameter and by doing that we're  allowing that 
      object to access every public member of that class.

Ans5: we can define max_size to something and use that where required when we 
      need to chsnge size we just change the define statement of that.

Ans6: After copying the array we should set the next character to null terminator i.e. '\0'.

Ans7: i have learned  constructors,how to put elements in safe empty state,using the reference "this" for current object
      and to pass class type objects.

ans 2: 1
ans 5 :
class oop244
{
   int nostudents;
   long* studentNo;
public:
    oop244();
    oop244(const char name[],int);
};

i could not get the how to declare class with resource.
