1) If the memmory is not deallocated the memory stays in the ram of pc and that is memory leak.

2) we need to allocate new dynamic memory when we increase the size of an existing array
   of dyanamically allocated memory because as we add new item to the array the firstly allocated memory becomes 
   insufficient to hold the new item so we need to allocate new dynamic memory.

3) no there is no memoryleak as it is static memory which is allocated to the application in run time.

4) the compiler knows which function it is by the number of parameters that we have passed since there is only stucture passed 
   in one function and structure and size passed in oher so compiler sees them as different and knows which one to call.

5) in this work shop i learned to use dynamic memory with pointers and how to allocate and deallocate them.

3)correct the following program to protect data from changes by the main() function and ensure that the number of students is non negative.
ans):
  #include <iostream>
  class oop244
 {
   int no students;
   public
      void display const 
    {
      if (noStudents>=0)
{
  std::cout << noStudents;
}
}
else{
  std::cout<< no data:
}
};

int main() 
{
oop244 sectionAB;
sectionAB.noStudents =79;

display();
}

6)
 Add the statements that displays the number e to 4 decimal places on standard output

ans:)
     #include <iostream
     int main()
{
double e = 2.71828182845;
cout.setf(ios::fixed);
cout.precision(4);
std::cout <<e << std::endl;
}
