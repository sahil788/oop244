1)if copy assignment operator would not chek for self assignment then the deallocation statement would release 
the memory holding the resource data and we would lose access to the source resource resulting in our logic failing.

2)If we do not declare a copy constructor, the compiler inserts code that implements a shallow copy. 
  If we do not declare a copy assignment operator, the compiler inserts code that implements a shallow assignment. 

3)i avoided duplicating of code by using the function in other functions so the same logic does not appear anywhere.

4)i have learned about overloading ,copy constructor and copy assingment operator and where and how to use them.
