1) A namespace is a scope for entities that it encloses.its purpose is to avoid same identifier naming conflicts
   for different variables.
2)We need header files when we need to access objects in an external library that we do not want to recompile
  or avoid interfering with.
3) We should never compile header files as we will include the header files in .cpp file and  while compiling it will
   automatically compile them if we compile header files then header files will compile twice.
4) we should never include .cpp files in another files as when compiling if we include them it will recompile and create a duplicate file.
5)The benefit of putting source code in modules is as a well designed module is highly cohesive and losely coupled and its easy
  to make changes to a module instead of whole source code when you are working with millions of lines.
6)from this workshop i learned how to crate modules and use them effectively and to safeguards the header files.
